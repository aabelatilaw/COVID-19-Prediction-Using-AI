COVID-19 Prediction Using AI
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the spread of COVID-19 cases over time.  The notebook forecasts future trends based on historical data of confirmed, recovered, and death cases.

📂 Project Overview
Objective: Predict the number of COVID-19 cases using machine learning algorithms.
Dataset: COVID-19 dataset with dates, confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
Models Used:
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Polynomial Regression
Visualizations: Plots showing historical data and predicted trends.
📊 Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Visualization of COVID-19 trends over time
Implementation of regression models for predictions
Forecast future confirmed cases
